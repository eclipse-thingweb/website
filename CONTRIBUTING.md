# Contributing to Eclipse Thingweb

Thanks for your interest in this project. General information
regarding source code management, builds, coding standards, and
more can be found here:

## Legal Requirements

Thingweb is an [Eclipse IoT](https://iot.eclipse.org) project and as such is governed by the Eclipse Development process.
This process helps us in creating great open source software within a safe legal framework.

Thus, before your contribution can be accepted by the project team, contributors must electronically sign the [Eclipse Contributor Agreement (ECA)](http://www.eclipse.org/legal/ECA.php) and follow these preliminary steps:

-   Obtain an [Eclipse Foundation account](https://accounts.eclipse.org/)
    -   Anyone who currently uses Eclipse Bugzilla or Gerrit systems already has one of those
    -   Newcomers can [create a new account](https://accounts.eclipse.org/user/register?destination=user)
-   Add your GiHub username to your Eclipse Foundation account
    -   ([Log into Eclipse](https://accounts.eclipse.org/))
    -   Go to the _Edit Profile_ tab
    -   Fill in the _GitHub ID_ under _Social Media Links_ and save
-   Sign the [Eclipse Contributor Agreement](http://www.eclipse.org/legal/ECA.php)
    -   ([Log into Eclipse](https://accounts.eclipse.org/))
    -   If the _Status_ entry _Eclipse Contributor Agreement_ has a green checkmark, the ECA is already signed
    -   If not, go to the _Eclipse Contributor Agreement_ tab or follow the corresponding link under _Status_
    -   Fill out the form and sign it electronically
-   Sign-off every commit using the same email address used for your Eclipse account
    -   Set the Git user email address with `git config user.email "<your Eclipse account email>"`
    -   Add the `-s` flag when you make the commit(s), e.g. `git commit -s -m "feat: add support for magic"`
-   Open a [Pull Request](https://github.com/eclipse-thingweb/node-wot/pulls)

## Commits

Eclipse Thingweb uses Conventional Changelog, which structure Git commit messages in a way that allows automatic generation of changelogs.
Commit messages must be structured as follows:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

-   `<type>`: A noun specifying the type of change, followed by a colon and a space. The types allowed are:
    -   `feat`: A new feature
    -   `fix`: A bug fix
    -   `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug or adds a feature (not relevant for end user)
    -   `perf`: Change improves performance
    -   `style`: Change does not affect the code (e.g., formatting, whitespaces)
    -   `test`: Adding missing tests
    -   `chore`: Change of build process or auxiliary tools
    -   `docs`: Documentation only changes
-   `<scope>`: Optional. A term of free choice specifying the place of the commit change, enclosed in parentheses. Examples:
    -   `feat(binding-coap): ...`
    -   `fix(cli): ...`
    -   `docs: ...` (no scope, as it is optional)
-   `<subject>`: A succinct description of the change, e.g., `add support for magic`
    -   Use the imperative, present tense: "add", not "added" nor "adds"
    -   Do not capitalize first letter: "add", not "Add"
    -   No dot (.) at the end
-   `<body>`: Optional. Can include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.
    -   Just as in the subject, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
-   `<footer>`: Optional. Can be used to automatically close GitHub Issues and to document breaking changes.
    -   The prefix `BREAKING CHANGE: ` idicates API breakage (corresponding to a major version change) and everything after is a description what changed and what needs to be done to migrate
    -   GitHub Issue controls such as `Fixes #123` or `Closes #4711` must come before a potential `BREAKING CHANGE: `.

Examples:

```
docs: improve how to contribute
```

```
feat(core): add support for magic

Closes #110
```

```
feat(core): add support for magic

Simplify the API by reducing the number of functions.

Closes #110
BREAKING CHANGE: Change all calls to the API to the new `do()` function.
```

## Pull Requests and Feature Branches

-   Do not merge with master while developing a new feature or providing a fix in a new branch
-   Do a rebase if updates in the master such as a fix are required:

```
git checkout master && git pull && git checkout - && git rebase master
```

-   Pull Requests are merged using rebase
