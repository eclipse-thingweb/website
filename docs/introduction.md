The Eclipse Thingweb node-wot is a framework for implementing Web of Things servers and clients in Node.js. It is written from the ground up with TypeScript with the goal of providing a fast and extensible framework for IoT applications. Node-wot enables developers to create complex business logic without worrying about protocols and low-level details, leveraging a standard metadata format called Thing Description (TD).

## Web of Things Principles in a Nutshell

The Web of Things (WoT) tackles IoT fragmentation by extending standardized web technologies. It simplifies IoT application development, promoting flexibility and interoperability, while preserving existing IoT standards. WoT offers an adaptable, abstract architecture based on real-world use cases across domains.

The **Thing Description (TD)** is a JSON-LD document that describes a Thing and its capabilities, including network services (APIs), interactions, and security requirements. TD is the cornerstone of the Web of Things architecture and node-wot uses it to implement its functionalities.

### WoT Capabilities:

- ‚öôÔ∏è **Properties**: Values that can be read, written, or observed (e.g., a temperature sensor with a current temperature property).
- ü¶æ **Actions**: Operations that can be invoked (e.g., turning a light bulb on or off).
- ‚ö° **Events**: Notifications triggered by events (e.g., motion detection by a sensor).

For more details, visit the [official W3C Web of Things website](https://www.w3.org/WoT/).

## Installation

The framework can be used as a **library** or as a **CLI tool**. Below are the installation methods for each.

### As a Library

The core package is `@node-wot/core`, which is mandatory. Other packages are bindings for different protocols.

#### Node.js

**Warning**: Node.js version 16 and lower are no longer supported.

- Node.js version 18+
- npm version 9+

**Linux**: Install node-gyp requirements:

- Python v3.6, v3.7, or v3.8
- Make
- A C/C++ compiler toolchain (e.g., GCC)

**Windows**: Install Windows build tools:

```bash
npm install -g --production windows-build-tools
```
````

**MacOS**: Install node-gyp tools:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

To install node-wot for Node.js:

```bash
npm i @node-wot/core @node-wot/binding-http --save
```

#### Browser

To use node-wot in the browser, install the browser bundle:

```bash
npm i @node-wot/browser-bundle --save
```

---

### As a CLI Tool

You can also use node-wot via its command line interface (CLI). More details are available in the [CLI tool's Readme](https://github.com/eclipse-thingweb/node-wot).

### As a Docker Image

To use node-wot inside a Docker container:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/eclipse-thingweb/node-wot
   ```
2. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   npm run build:docker
   ```
3. Run the container:
   ```bash
   docker run --rm wot-servient -h
   ```

---

## Examples

With node-wot, you can either **expose** a Thing (server-side) or **consume** a Thing (client-side). Below is an example of how to create and expose a counter Thing and how to consume it.

#### Expose a Thing (Server-Side)

```javascript
const { Servient } = require("@node-wot/core");
const { HttpServer } = require("@node-wot/binding-http");

const servient = new Servient();
servient.addServer(new HttpServer());

servient.start().then(async (WoT) => {
  let count = 0;
  const exposingThing = await WoT.produce({
    title: "Counter",
    description: "A simple counter thing",
    properties: {
      count: {
        type: "integer",
        description: "current counter value",
        observable: true,
        readOnly: true,
      },
    },
    actions: {
      increment: {
        description: "increment counter value",
      },
    },
  });
  exposingThing.setPropertyReadHandler("count", () => {
    return count;
  });
  exposingThing.setActionHandler("increment", () => {
    count++;
    exposingThing.emitPropertyChange("count");
  });
  await exposingThing.expose();
});
```

#### Consume a Thing (Client-Side)

```javascript
const { Servient } = require("@node-wot/core");
const { HttpClientFactory } = require("@node-wot/binding-http");

const servient = new Servient();
servient.addClientFactory(new HttpClientFactory(null));

servient
  .start()
  .then(async (WoT) => {
    const td = await WoT.requestThingDescription(
      "http://localhost:8080/counter"
    );
    let thing = await WoT.consume(td);
    thing.observeProperty("count", async (data) => {
      console.log("count:", await data.value());
    });
    for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
      await thing.invokeAction("increment");
    }
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.error(err);
  });
```
