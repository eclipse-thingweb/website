# Services for W3C WoT Developers

Eclipse Thingweb provides services to support Web of Things developers. These services are listed below.

## Thing Description Playground

Playground is a tool to validate TDs and manipulate them for usage in other tools. You can do validation to check conformance, generate Open API and Async API documents, add or remove default values, visualize TDs and find spelling mistakes in TDs.

- [Online Tool](https://playground.thingweb.io)
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/eclipse-thingweb/playground)

## Web-based Interactions with Things

Using the tools below, you can interact with different WoT Things over your browser.

- [Browserified node-wot](https://thingweb.io/webui/): You can try interacting with different Things using this simple interface. Note that this is just a demo page to showcase the [browser bundle of node-wot](https://github.com/eclipse-thingweb/node-wot/tree/master/packages/browser-bundle).
- [WoT-FXUI](https://github.com/danielpeintner/wot-fxui): JavaFX-based UI to interact with Things (runnable as Web application, local desktop application or as an Android/iOS app).

## Online Things for Testing

Eclipse Thingweb hosts Things that can be interacted with over the public Internet. You can use them to test your WoT applications.
You can find the details under the [test-things](https://github.com/eclipse-thingweb/test-things/) repository with a collection of IoT device simulators that can be used for testing and exploration purposes of different protocols and other Web of Things mechanisms.
